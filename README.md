# Trip-Based-Modelling-of-Fuel-Consumption-in-Modern-Fleet-Vehicles-ADS_TEAM_137
The project "Trip Based Modeling of Fuel Consumption in Modern Fleet Vehicles" aims to develop a sophisticated model for accurately predicting and analyzing fuel consumption in modern fleet vehicles. This project focuses on leveraging data-driven techniques and advanced algorithms to create a robust system that can provide valuable insights into fuel efficiency and optimize fleet management practices.
In today's world, fuel consumption plays a critical role in the operational costs and environmental impact of fleet vehicles. Efficient fuel management is vital for reducing expenses, minimizing carbon emissions, and ensuring optimal vehicle performance. By developing a trip-based fuel consumption model, this project aims to empower fleet operators, transportation companies, and researchers with a tool that can enhance decision-making processes and contribute to sustainable practices.
